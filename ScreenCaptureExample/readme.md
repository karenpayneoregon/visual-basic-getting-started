Using this code in a project.

- Add the C# project to your Visual Studio solution.
- If there are issues building the VB.NET project, check the .NET Framework is the same version in both projects.
- Add the following import statement to the form or class using the library **Imports ScreenLibrary**
- Use code shown in the form here.
