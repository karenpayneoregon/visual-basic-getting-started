## Before running this project

Run the database script, DatabaseScript.sql found in this project. Open the script in Visual Studio or in [SSMS](http://example.com), make sure the path to place the database is correct for your computer then execute the script.

## Entity Framework/Entity Framework Core

The current code would be much less using any flavor of Entity Framework for many operations. No plans for Entity Framework 6 code samle to match this as Entity Framework 6 although it's still a choice developers need to move up to EF Core which does not have native reverse engineering so to present this there would also need to be a lesson on reverse engineering a database which is outside the scope of this artice.
